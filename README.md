## Introduction

This project is designed to help developers understand and implement various data structures and algorithms using JavaScript. Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in a modular fashion, making it easy to understand and reuse.

## Features

- Implementation of common data structures such as Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and more.
- Implementation of various algorithms including sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and others.
- Clear and concise code with comments explaining each step.
- Example usage of each data structure and algorithm.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-with-javascript.git
    cd dsa-with-javascript
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

### Examples

To run the examples, you can use Node.js. For example, to run the example for a linked list:

```sh
node examples/linkedListExample.js
